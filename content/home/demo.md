Aging is one of the biggest mysteries of biology. “Why we age?” is a basic biological question, and at the same time, it is highly medically relevant. Aging is associated with the accumulation of mutations and genomic instability.

We study age-related changes in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks using human cells and transgenic mice. We are also using a comparative approach to study aging by analyzing short- and long-lived animal species.

Finally, as aging is associated with increased cancer incidence, we study DNA repair in breast cancer cells, and anti-cancer mechanisms in short- and long-lived rodents
